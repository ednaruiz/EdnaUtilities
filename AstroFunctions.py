  The highest point in the sky, 
  called meridian, is the projection of a longitude 
  line onto the celestial sphere. Since a complete circle
  contains 24h of right ascension or 360° (degrees of arc),  
  1⁄24 of a circle is measured as 1h of right ascension, or 15°;  
  1⁄(24×60) of a circle is measured as 1m of right ascension, or 15 
  minutes of arc (also written as 15′); and  1⁄(24×60×60) 
  of a circle contains 1s of right ascension, or 15 seconds 
  of arc (also written as 15″). A full circle, measured in 
  right-ascension units, contains 24 × 60 × 60 = 86 400s, or 24 × 60 = 1 440m, or 24h.
